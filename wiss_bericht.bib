  abstract = {In 2008, the National Research Council published a landmark report on Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) and defined it as ‘an emerging discipline that aims to integrate computational materials science tools into a holistic system that can accelerate materials development, transform the engineering design optimization process, \& unify design and manufacturing’. ICME is becoming a critical enabler for reducing the design/make cycle time and getting complex systems into production more quickly. There are several reasons why this is the case. Firstly, ICME allows materials experts to develop new material systems and methods of manufacture much more quickly. Advanced new materials and their associated manufacturing processes can be tailored to deliver products that meet design requirements quickly and more effectively in terms of cost and performance. Secondly, ICME enables design processes to quantify cause and affect relationships between manufacturing methods and variability, material properties, product geometry, and design requirement margins. In the design phase, material selection itself can impose consideration of material-specific failure modes that are naturally correlated to important attributes such as strength, weight, and geometry. ICME enables designers to quickly understand the complex and probabilistic interactions between the material, manufacturing processes, manufacturing variability, and design. Thirdly, it has been shown that successful account of variability of the manufacturing processes in life calculations leads to improved accuracy in declared low cycle fatigue crack initiation and damage tolerance lives on life limited gas turbine engine components. Furthermore, ICME enables engineers to rapidly explore more effective design and manufacturing solutions for delivering superior products at lower cost, faster but not without challenges. To highlight challenges and progress toward realization of this transformational technology, a survey of recent examples of materials and manufacturing process simulations along with the overarching approach and requirements within ICME to link these simulation capabilities to design and manufacturing methods will be reviewed from a gas turbine engine perspective.},

  abstract = {Integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) represents a grand challenge within materials research and development. Effective ICME involves coupling materials characterization and experimentation with simulation tools to produce a holistic understanding of the materials system, promising to accelerate the materials development enterprise. Under the Center of Excellence on Integrated Materials Modeling (CEIMM), significant strides were made in developing state-of-the-art experimental methods and simulation techniques for interrogating material structure and behavior across multiple scales. In parallel to these method developments, several advances were made in designing data structures and workflow tools that possess the required flexibility and extensibility to operate on the data produced by such advanced methods. Such software tools are a critical enabling component for effective ICME; the National Academy of Sciences noted cyberinfrastructure as a crucial factor for ICME, to include databases, software, and computational hardware [1]. Additionally, these tools enable workflows that properly integrate models and experimentation at each stage of the materials development lifecycle. Figure 1 schematically shows such a workflow for optimization of microstructure and properties in a titanium forging.},

In this article, we detail progress on the design of a low-Re, castable, creep-resistant, single-crystal Ni-based superalloy (QTSX). CALPHAD-based indicators for castability (liquid buoyancy) and creep resistance (γ′ coarsening rate constant) were simultaneously employed to predict an optimum alloy composition. Component-level QTSX trail castings have been fabricated, and characterization of the castings has demonstrated freckle-free solidification and creep resistance comparable to CMSX4 and ReneN5, which validates this accelerated ICME approach.},

  abstract = {An interpenetrating aluminum–alumina composite is presented, based on a ceramic foam manufactured via a novel slurry-based route resulting in a highly homogeneous preform microstructure in contrast to other preform techniques. The metal matrix composite (MMC) is produced by infiltrating the open-porous ceramic preform with molten aluminum at 700 °C using a Argon-driven gas pressure infiltration process. The resulting MMC and the primary ceramic foam are investigated both numerically and experimentally in terms of microstructural characteristics. In addition, the mechanical behavior of the material as well as the structural and material interactions on the microscale are investigated. To characterize the MMC regarding mechanical isotropy, elastic properties are determined experimentally via ultrasonic phase spectroscopy (UPS). A fast Fourier transform (FFT) formulation is used to simulate the complex 3D microstructure with reasonable effort based on image-data gathered from high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans of the ceramic foam as computational grid. Simulations prove that the material properties are, indeed, considered as highly homogeneous with respect to the material microstructure. A comparison with effective experimental investigations confirms these findings.},

  abstract = {Low density, high strength, and high creep and oxidation resistance properties of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) make them an ideal choice for use in extreme environments in space and military applications. This paper presents a detailed characterization study of structural and manufacturing flaws in Carbon fiber Silicon-Carbide-Nitride matrix (C/SiNC) CMCs at different length-scales. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) is used for the chemical characterization of the material’s elemental constituents. High-resolution multiscale graphs obtained from scanning electron microscope (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM) are used to characterize the distribution and morphology of defects at different length scales. This is followed by the classification and quantification of the common manufacturing defects. An image processing algorithm based on the image segmentation process is developed to quantify the variability of various scale-dependent architectural parameters. Finally, a three-dimensional stochastic representative volume element (SRVE) generation algorithm is developed to provide precise representations of material textures at multiple length scales. The developed algorithm accurately accounts for material features and flaws based on a range of multiscale structural and defects characterization results.},
